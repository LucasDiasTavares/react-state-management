## learning-state-management
Learning the basics of state management. Here I'm doing a movie site. I have a list of objects:

### ```
export const MovieProvider = props => {
  const [movies, setMovies] = useState([
{
  name: 'MovieName',
  price: 'MoviePrice',
  id: 123456789
},
{
  name: 'MovieName2',
  price: 'MoviePrice2',
  id: 1234567892
}
]);
```

To get access of this data in any part of my code i need to create a new file with the name like 'MovieContex.js', then import createContext.

### ` import React { createContext } from 'react';`

### `export const MovieContext = createContext();`

my return needs to be like this:
### ```
return (
<MovieContext.Provider value={[movies, setMovies]}>
  {props.children}
</MovieContext.Provider>
);
```


Now I need to open my App.js and:
### `import { MovieProvider } from './MovieListContex';`

So now I wrap every thing that need to use this information.
### ```
function App() {
  return (
    <MovieProvider>
      <div className='App'>
        <Navbar />
        <MovieList />
      </div>
    </MovieProvider>
  );
}
```

OK, but how can I access this information throgh the others components?

Easy, back to my MovieList.js
### ```
import React, { useContext } from 'react';
import Movie from './Movie';
import { MovieContext } from './MovieListContex';
```

### ```
const MovieList = () => {
  const [movies] = useContext(MovieContext);
  return (
    <div>
      {movies.map(movie => (
        <Movie name={movie.name} price={movie.price} key={movie.id} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Another example in my Navbar.js

In this little project I have learned it.

### Important: My big problem here is when I create a new movie, updates all the components wrapped.
